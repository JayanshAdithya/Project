✅ 1. Extended Email Notification Plugin (EXTENDED EMAIL)

The Extended E-mail Plugin (Email-ext plugin) allows Jenkins to send customized email notifications after a build completes.

🔥 Why it is needed

The default Jenkins email is basic.
Extended Email lets you:

Send emails for SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, or every stage

Customize subject line, body, HTML format

Attach build logs, reports, artifacts

Apply conditions (e.g., email only on failure)

📌 Typical Use Case

You want developers to get notified ONLY if a build fails, with logs attached.

📌 Example configuration (Freestyle Job)

Post-build Actions → Editable Email Notification

Recipients: team@example.com

Subject: “Build ${BUILD_STATUS} for job ${JOB_NAME}”

Content: Custom message body

Triggers: Failure — checked

📌 Pipeline example
post {
    failure {
        emailext(
            to: "team@example.com",
            subject: "Build Failed: ${env.JOB_NAME}",
            body: "Check console output: ${env.BUILD_URL}"
        )
    }
}

✅ 2. Copy Artifact Plugin (COPY ARTIFACT)

This plugin allows one Jenkins job to copy files/artifacts from another Jenkins job.

🔥 Why it is needed

Used in multi-stage pipelines:

BUILD → TEST → DEPLOY


The test job needs the artifacts created by the build job.
The deploy job needs the WAR created by the test job.

📌 Where used in your assignment

MavenJava_Test copies artifacts from MavenJava_Build

MavenWeb_Deploy copies artifacts from MavenWeb_Test

📌 Example configuration

In job → Build Step → Copy artifacts from another project

Project name: MavenWeb_Build

Which build: Latest Successful

Files: **/*

📌 Pipeline example
steps {
    copyArtifacts(
        projectName: 'MavenWeb_Build',
        selector: lastSuccessful()
    )
}

✅ 3. Deploy to Container Plugin (DEPLOY TO)

Used to deploy WAR/EAR files automatically to servers like:

Tomcat

JBoss

GlassFish

WildFly

🔥 Why it is needed

Before this plugin, you would deploy WAR manually by copying it into Tomcat’s webapps folder.

This plugin automates deployment:

Connects to Tomcat Manager

Uploads WAR

Restarts application

📌 Where used in your assignment

In MavenWeb_Deploy, you have a post-build action:

Deploy WAR/EAR to a container


Settings:

WAR file: **/*.war

Context path: /webpath

Tomcat URL: http://localhost:8085/

Credentials: admin / 1234

📌 Pipeline example
deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat-creds', 
    url: 'http://localhost:8085')],
    war: '**/*.war',
    contextPath: '/webpath'

✅ 4. Build Pipeline Plugin (BUILD PIPELINE)

This plugin gives a visual pipeline view (flowchart) for multi-job projects.

🔥 Why it is needed

Freestyle jobs do not show a connected graphic pipeline.

With this plugin, you can see:

MavenJava_Build → MavenJava_Test


or

MavenWeb_Build → MavenWeb_Test → MavenWeb_Deploy


Each job shows:

Status (green/red)

Build number

Trigger arrow

📌 How to use

Dashboard → + New View → Select Build Pipeline View

Configure:

Initial job → MavenWeb_Build

Layout → Based on upstream/downstream

📌 Output example
[Build] → [Test] → [Deploy]

✅ 5. Pipeline Stage View Plugin (STAGE VIEW)

This plugin provides a graphical layout of the Declarative Pipeline Jenkinsfile.

🔥 Why it is needed

For pipeline jobs using Jenkinsfile:

stage('Clone')
stage('Build')
stage('Test')
stage('Deploy')


The Stage View shows each stage as a visual box with:

Stage duration

Status (green/red)

Logs

Parallel steps

📌 Example Stage View
Clone ✓   Build ✓   Test ✓   Deploy ✓

📌 Installed automatically with Pipeline plugins
✅ 6. Maven Integration Plugin (MAVEN)

This plugin helps Jenkins run Maven goals like:

clean

install

test

package

🔥 Why it is needed

Maven is commonly used for:

Java projects

WAR packaging

Dependency management

Unit testing

Jenkins integrates with Maven so you can build Java apps easily.

📌 How used in your assignment

Freestyle job → Build Step → Invoke top-level Maven targets

Examples:

👉 Build Job:

Goals: clean
Goals: install


👉 Test Job:

Goals: test

📌 Pipeline example
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        sh 'mvn clean install'
    }
}
